<h3 id=websock>Libwebsockets</h3>

Jsi links agains Libwebockets, which is covered by LGPL
with an extra clause allowing static linking.

    <nowiki><pre class=verbatim>
Libwebsockets and included programs are provided under the terms of the GNU
Library General Public License (LGPL) 2.1, with the following exceptions:

1) Static linking of programs with the libwebsockets library does not
constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide
source code for the program, use the shared libwebsockets libraries, or
link their program against a user-supplied version of libwebsockets.

If you link the program to a modified version of libwebsockets, then the
changes to libwebsockets must be provided under the terms of the LGPL in
sections 1, 2, and 4.

2) You do not have to provide a copy of the libwebsockets license with
programs that are linked to the libwebsockets library, nor do you have to
identify the libwebsockets license in your program or documentation as
required by section 6 of the LGPL.

However, programs must still identify their use of libwebsockets. The
following example statement can be included in user documentation to
satisfy this requirement:

"[program] is based in part on the work of the libwebsockets  project
(http://libwebsockets.org)"

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999
...
</pre></nowiki>

Note this seems to to say that as long as libwebsockets is not modified,
all that is required is an acknowledgement in your user documentation.

<h3 id=other>Others</h3>

Other software including sqlite, miniz, jsmn, regex from musl,
etc are either public domain, BSD or MIT compatible.

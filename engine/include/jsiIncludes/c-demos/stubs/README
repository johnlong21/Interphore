This example demonstrates the use of Stub extensions.
Stubs provide dynamic loading of extensions with backward compatibility.
Jsi itself comes with stub support builtin by compiling with -DJSI_USE_STUBS.
However user extensions can also be Stubbed.

The example starts with the "demo" extension. It provides a JS command "demo()",
and 2 C functions Demo_Incr and Demo_Decr.

The second extension "user" is then loaded.  It uses stub support 
provided by "demo" to access it's C code Demo_Incr and Demo_Decr.

Stubbing works as follows:
The file demoStubs.h is generated from demo.h using tools/mkstubs.js.
Note in demo.h the comments /*STUB = 1*/ etc.
These define the slot in the stub table, which should never change.
New functions can be added to the end, but old ones should not change.
